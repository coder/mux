title: Docker Runtime
description: Run agents in isolated Docker containers
---

Docker runtime runs each workspace in a separate Docker container, providing full isolation.

## Why use Docker runtime

- **Full isolation**: Each workspace runs in its own container with no shared state
- **Reproducible environments**: Pin exact images for consistent tooling
- **Security**: Container sandboxing limits agent access to host system

## How it works

1. When you create a Docker workspace, mux starts a container from your chosen image
2. Your project code is synced to `/src` inside the container via git bundle
3. Commands run inside the container with `docker exec`
4. Deleting the workspace removes the container

## Configuration

Select Docker in the workspace creation UI and specify an image:

- `node:20` - Node.js with git pre-installed
- `python:3.12` - Python with git pre-installed
- Custom images with your toolchain
