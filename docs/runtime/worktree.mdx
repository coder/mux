Worktree runtime uses [git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) on your local machine.

Each workspace gets its own directory, but worktrees share the same `.git` directory as your main checkout.

## How worktrees work

A worktree is a separate directory on the same filesystem as the main repository.

- It has its own working tree (files on disk) and checkout state.
- It shares a `.git` with the main repository.

Because `.git` is shared, **commits created in any worktree are immediately visible to your other worktrees (including your main checkout).**

Worktrees aren’t locked to a branch. The agent can switch branches, enter detached HEAD, or create new branches as needed. If you want to constrain branching behavior, do it via your [instruction files](/agents/instruction-files).

## Filesystem layout

Worktree workspaces are stored in `~/.mux/src/<project-name>/<workspace-name>`.

Example layout:

```text
~/.mux/src/
  mux-main/
    improved-auth-ux/
    fix-ci-flakes/
```
