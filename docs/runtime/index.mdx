Runtimes determine where and how mux executes agent workspaces.

| Runtime                           | Isolation                                  | Best For                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **[Local](/runtime/local)**       | All workspaces share the project directory | Quick edits to your working copy          |
| **[Worktree](/runtime/worktree)** | Each workspace gets its own directory      | Running multiple agents in parallel       |
| **[SSH](/runtime/ssh)**           | Remote execution over SSH                  | Security, performance, heavy parallelism  |
| **[Docker](/runtime/docker)**     | Isolated container per workspace           | Full isolation, reproducible environments |

## Choosing a Runtime

Choose a runtime when creating a workspace.

## Init Hooks

[Init hooks](/hooks/init) and agent bash tool executions can detect the runtime type via the `MUX_RUNTIME` environment variable:

- `local` — Local runtime
- `worktree` — Worktree runtime
- `ssh` — SSH runtime
- `docker` — Docker runtime

This lets your init hook adapt behavior, e.g., skip worktree-specific setup when running in local mode.
