title: Why Parallelize?
description: Use cases for running multiple AI agents in parallel

A few reasons parallel workspaces matter:

- **Keep context aligned**: Create dedicated workspaces for threads like `code-review`, `refactor`, and `new-feature`.
- **Run long jobs in the background**: Kick off a slow, high-accuracy model for a deep investigation or refactor.
  - Streams resume after restarts or intermittent connection issues.
  - Mux shows an indicator when the model finishes.
- **A/B implementations**: Try multiple approaches to the same problem and keep the best one.
- **Tangent management**: Fork or create a new workspace for side quests so the main thread stays focused.
