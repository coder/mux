title: Forking Workspaces
description: Clone workspaces with conversation history to explore alternatives
---

Use `/fork` to clone a workspace with its full conversation history and UI state. Forking creates a new workspace on a new branch (using the same backend as the current workspace).

You can fork either:

- By running `/fork` in chat
- By clicking the **Fork** button on any completed assistant message

## Usage

```
/fork [new-workspace-name]
```

If you omit the name, mux will auto-generate one based on the current workspace:

- `<name>-fork`
- `<name>-fork-2`
- `<name>-fork-3`
- ...

## Use cases

- **Explore alternatives**: Fork mid-conversation to try a different implementation approach.
- **Isolate tangents**: See an unrelated bug or opportunity in the course of a change? Fork to keep the main conversation on track.
- **Create backup**: Fork to keep a copy of an old conversation before a risky change in direction.

## What happens when you fork

The new workspace:

- Appears at the top of the workspace list (most recent)
- Uses the provided workspace name (or an auto-generated one; you can rename later)
- Branches from the current workspace's HEAD commit

**What's copied**: Conversation history, model selection, thinking level, auto-retry setting, UI mode (plan/exec), chat input text

**What's not copied**: Uncommitted file changes (new branch starts from HEAD)
