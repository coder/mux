description: Isolated development environments for parallel agent work
---

Workspaces let you run multiple agent sessions in parallel.

Each workspace has its own chat history and, depending on runtime, its own working directory and Git checkout state.

## Runtimes

Runtimes decide where a workspace runs and how isolated its filesystem is:

- **[Local](/runtime/local)**: Runs directly in your project directory. No filesystem isolation.
- **[Worktree](/runtime/worktree)**: Creates a local [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) for per-workspace isolation while still sharing `.git`.
- **[SSH](/runtime/ssh)**: Runs on a remote host over SSH (useful for security isolation and heavy parallelism).

## Key concepts

- **Branch flexibility**: A workspace can switch branches, use detached HEAD, or create new branches as needed.
- **Commit visibility**: Local + worktree runtimes share the same Git repository. Commits made in one workspace are immediately visible to your other worktrees and your main checkout.
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple workspaces can work on different tasks concurrently.

## Reviewing changes

A few common workflows (from "agent edits only" → "agent owns the PR"):

- **Agent edits only**: Open the workspace directory and stage/commit yourself (`git add -p`).
- **Agent commits**: Review locally from your main checkout (for example `git show <workspace-branch>`), then push when you’re satisfied.
- **Agent commits + pushes**: Ask the agent to open a PR and review in GitHub/GitLab.
  - Also see: [Agentic Git Identity](/config/agentic-git-identity)
  - This requires granting the workspace git push credentials; prefer a dedicated identity/token.

## Reviewing functionality (UI, behavior)

Some changes (especially UI ones) are faster to review by running the workspace locally.

1. Ask the agent to commit when it’s ready for review.
2. If the workspace is a **worktree**, check out the branch in a detached HEAD state from your main checkout:

   ```bash
   git checkout --detach <workspace-branch>
   ```

<Note>
  Detached HEAD is useful here because a branch can only be checked out by one worktree at a time.
</Note>

If you want faster iteration between commits, open the workspace directory and run a dev server (for example `bun dev`) there directly.
