description: Extend agent capabilities with Model Context Protocol servers
---

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers provide additional tools to agents. Configure them per-project in `.mux/mcp.jsonc`.

## Configuration

Create `.mux/mcp.jsonc` in your project root:

```jsonc
{
  "servers": {
    // Knowledge graph for persistent memory
    "memory": "npx -y @anthropic-ai/mcp-server-memory",
    // Access external APIs
    "github": "npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github",
  },
}
```

Each entry maps a server name to its shell command. The command must start a process that speaks MCP over stdio (NDJSON format).

## Settings UI

Configure servers in **Settings → Projects**:

1. Select a project from the dropdown
2. Add servers with name and command
3. Use **Test** to verify before adding
4. View available tools after successful test

## Behavior

- **Hot reload** — Config changes apply on your next message (no restart needed)
- **Per-workspace** — Each workspace maintains its own server instances
- **Isolated** — Server processes run in the workspace directory with its environment

## Finding MCP Servers

Browse available servers at [mcp.so](https://mcp.so/) or the [MCP servers repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).

## Troubleshooting

If a server fails to start:

1. **Test the command manually** — Run the command in your terminal to verify it works
2. **Check dependencies** — Ensure required packages are installed (`npx -y` downloads on first run)
3. **Review logs** — Server errors appear in mux logs (`~/.mux/logs/`)
