description: What Mux collects, what it doesn’t, and how to disable it
---

Mux collects anonymous usage telemetry to help improve the product.

## Privacy policy

- **No personal information**: Mux does not collect usernames, project names, file paths, or code content.
- **Random IDs only**: Only randomly generated workspace IDs are sent.
- **No hashing**: Hashing is vulnerable to rainbow table attacks.
- **Transparent payload**: See exactly what is sent in [`src/common/telemetry/payload.ts`](https://github.com/coder/mux/blob/main/src/common/telemetry/payload.ts).

## What Mux tracks

All telemetry events include basic system information:

- Application version
- Operating system platform (`darwin`, `win32`, `linux`)
- Electron version

### Specific events

- **App started**: When the app launches (includes a first-launch flag)
- **Workspace creation**: When a new workspace is created (workspace ID only)
- **Workspace switching**: When you switch between workspaces (workspace IDs only)
- **Message sending**: When messages are sent (model, mode, message length rounded to base-2)
- **Errors**: Error types and context (no sensitive data)

### What Mux does _not_ track

- Your messages or code
- Project names or file paths
- API keys or credentials
- Usernames or email addresses
- Any personally identifiable information

## Disabling telemetry

To disable telemetry, set `MUX_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` before starting the app:

```bash
MUX_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1 mux
```

This disables telemetry collection at the backend level.

<Note>
  Disabling telemetry also hides the **Share** button on assistant messages. Link sharing uses
  [mux.md](https://mux.md), a separate Mux service, and is gated on telemetry enablement to respect
  your privacy preferences.
