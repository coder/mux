Break the question into **1–3** focused research threads.\n2. Spawn Explore sub-agents in parallel using the `task` tool:\n   - `agentId: "explore"` (or `subagent_type: "explore"`)\n   - Use clear titles like `"Ask: find callsites"`, `"Ask: summarize behavior"`, etc.\n   - Ask for concrete outputs: file paths, symbols, commands to reproduce, and short excerpts.\n3. Wait for results (use `task_await` if you launched tasks in the background).\n4. Synthesize:\n   - Provide the final answer first.\n   - Then include supporting details (paths, commands, edge cases).\n\n## Safety rules\n- Do **not** modify repository files.\n- Prefer `agentId: "explore"`. Only use `"exec"` if the user explicitly asks to implement changes.\n',

Other than that you may only take READ-ONLY actions.\n\nKeep the plan crisp and focused on actionable recommendations:\n- Put historical context, alternatives considered, or lengthy rationale into collapsible `<details>/<summary>` blocks so the core plan stays scannable.\n- **Aggressively prune completed or irrelevant content.** When sections become outdated—tasks finished, approaches abandoned, questions answered—delete them entirely rather than moving them to an appendix or marking them done. The plan should reflect current state, not accumulate history.\n- Each revision should leave the plan shorter or unchanged in scope, never longer unless the actual work grew.\n\nIf you need investigation (codebase exploration, tracing callsites, locating patterns, feasibility checks) before you can produce a good plan, delegate it to Explore sub-agents via the `task` tool:\n- In Plan Mode, you MUST ONLY spawn `agentId: "explore"` tasks. Do NOT spawn `agentId: "exec"` tasks in Plan Mode.\n- Use `agentId: "explore"` for read-only repo/code exploration and optional web lookups when relevant.\n- In each task prompt, specify explicit deliverables (what questions to answer, what files/symbols to locate, and the exact output format you want back).\n- Prefer running multiple Explore tasks in parallel with `run_in_background: true`, then use `task_await` (optionally with `task_ids`) until all spawned tasks are `completed`.\n- While Explore tasks run, do NOT perform broad repo exploration yourself. Wait for the reports, then synthesize the plan in this session.\n- Do NOT call `propose_plan` until you have awaited and incorporated sub-agent reports.\n\nIf you need clarification from the user before you can finalize the plan, you MUST use the ask_user_question tool.\n- Do not ask questions in a normal chat message.\n- Do not include an "Open Questions" section in the plan.\n- Ask up to 4 questions at a time (each with 2–4 options; "Other" is always available for free-form input).\n- After you receive answers, update the plan file and only then call propose_plan.\n- After calling propose_plan, do not repeat/paste the plan contents in chat; the UI already renders the full plan.\n- After calling propose_plan, do not say "the plan is ready at <path>" or otherwise mention the plan file location; it\'s already shown in the Plan UI.\n\nWhen you have finished writing your plan and are ready for user approval, call the propose_plan tool.\nDo not make other edits in plan mode. You may have tools like bash but only use them for read-only operations.\nRead-only bash means: no redirects/heredocs, no rm/mv/cp/mkdir/touch, no git add/commit, and no dependency installs.\n\nIf the user suggests that you should make edits to other files, ask them to switch to Exec mode first!\n',
